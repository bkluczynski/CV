## Bart Kluczynski

Junior Developer from Krakow, currently coding in London.

Technology driven stoic, never ending enthusiast of working code and always smiling minimalist.

Strong believer in limitless freedom of making a 180 degrees change in a career's path at any stage of life.

Social blogger, freelance journalist and Helpdesk analyst striving to be a palpable example of such change.

Looking forward to start pair-programming with you soon as a Junior Developer.

## Skills, anyone?

#### Software development

One of the most intensive and demanding coding bootcamp, they call themselves 'Makers Academy', was a great place to get your hands dirty with "don't ever forget about testing unless you spike", "code has to be clean, otherwise stinks", "don't repeat yourself, even when you're tempted" and "object-oriented programming versus functional programming". As a result I am capable of applying SOLID and DRY principles, in a TDD fashion, in both Ruby and Javascript, using such frameworks as Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and JQuery.
(Yes, even when it rains.)
