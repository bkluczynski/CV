## Bart Kluczynski

Technology driven stoic, never ending enthusiast of working code and always smiling minimalist. Strong believer in limitless freedom of making a 180 degrees change in a career's path at any stage of life. Social blogger, freelance journalist and Helpdesk analyst striving to be a palpable example of such change.

Looking forward to start pair-programming with you soon as a Junior Developer.

## Skills, anyone?

#### Software development

One of the most intensive and demanding coding bootcamp, they call themselves 'Makers Academy', was a great place to get your hands dirty with "don't ever forget about testing unless you spike", "pair-programming is fun", "code has to be clean, otherwise stinks", "don't repeat yourself, even when you're tempted" and "object-oriented programming versus functional programming".

As a result I am capable of applying SOLID and DRY principles, in a TDD fashion(Capybara, Mocha, Jasmine and Rspec), in both Ruby and Javascript, using such frameworks as Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and JQuery together with SQL and PSQL databases.
(Yes, even when it rains.)

#### Multipotentiality

Having finished Makers Academy bootcamp does not only mean that as a graduate I've experience working with particular technologies. The most important ability that I've managed to enhance is multipotentiality, or just adjustability. Makers did great job in showing students how different technologies work together and allowed me to see a pattern in every language, framework or technology that can be pragmatically used, as a very efficient tool to learn and understand a new technology.

#### Communication
