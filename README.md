## Bart Kluczynski

Technology driven stoic, never ending enthusiast of working code and always smiling minimalist. Strong believer in the limitless freedom of making a 180 degrees change in a career's path at any stage of life. Social blogger, freelance journalist and Helpdesk analyst striving to be a palpable example of such change.

Looking forward to start pair-programming with you soon as a Junior Developer.

## Skills, anyone?

#### Software development

One of the most intensive and demanding coding bootcamp, they call themselves 'Makers Academy', was a great place to get your hands dirty with "don't ever forget about testing unless you spike", "pair-programming is fun", "code has to be clean, otherwise stinks", "don't repeat yourself, even when you're tempted" and "object-oriented programming versus functional programming".

As a result I am capable of applying SOLID and DRY principles, in a TDD fashion(Capybara, Mocha, Jasmine and Rspec), in both Ruby and Javascript, using such frameworks as Ruby on Rails, Sinatra and JQuery together with SQL and PSQL databases.
(Yes, even when it rains.)

##### Examples

| Project | Team Size | Description | Technologies |
|---------|:---------:|-------------|--------------|
|[Blank_canvas](https://github.com/bkluczynski/blank_canvas) | 5 | Makers Academy final project. An app allowing a person to upload a picture, extract dominant colours and apply them to blank and white SVG drawing (drag and drop) to finally be able to save the canvas as an image file.|Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, Interact.js, CSS, HTML, SVG  |
|[Chitter](https://github.com/bkluczynski/chitter-challenge) | 1 | A Twitter clone | Sinatra, Ruby, HTML, CSS |
|[Social_event_reminder](https://github.com/bkluczynski/social_event_reminder) | 5 | Makers Academy mid project. An app to connect with your family through sending and receiving reminders regarding an important family event. | Rails, Twilio API, CSS, HTML  |

#### Multipotentiality

Having finished Makers Academy bootcamp does not only mean that as a graduate I've experience working with particular technologies. The most important ability that I've managed to enhance is multipotentiality, or adjustability if you prefer. Makers did great job in showing students how different technologies work together and allowed me to see a pattern in every language, framework or technology that can be pragmatically used, as a very efficient tool to learn and understand a new technology. Okay, maybe not in every one of them, but you get the gist, right?

#### Communication

This one is a fancy ability that almost everybody brings up as one of their core skills. I will be the same, but different. As a Helpdesk analyst working for a telecommunication startup I had more than a handful of opportunities to face challenging conversations with disgruntled customers. On many occasions their level of understanding technical, network-related terminology wasn't up to scratch and that's when my soft skills were taking over, so I could deliver a concise explanation with a smile. Clarity and coherence were also relevant when pair-programming with different students every day at Makers Academy for sometimes 12 hours a day.

## Education? Yes, please!

#### Makers Academy (June 2016 to September 2016)

Makers Academy is a highly selective 12 week full-time program (preceded by a four week pre-course) which teaches web development in London. Courses start every six weeks at the new Makers HQ in Shoreditch and admission is highly competitive. Makers Academy accepts only the exceptional applicants onto the course, for a rigorous program that culminates in graduation. The final week for the students is dedicated to their future ambitions.
